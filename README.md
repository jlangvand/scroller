scroller
========

Simple scrolling game for the Arduino with a HD44780 LCD display

On the first run, hold the SELECT key while resetting the Arduino to clear address 200 in the EEPROM (holds the highscore)

A buzzer can be connected to pin 12 for sound effects. Hold the DOWN key while resetting to toggle sound effects on or off.
